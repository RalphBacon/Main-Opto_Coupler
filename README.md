# Mains Opto Coupler
A SAFE way to detect mains from your microcontroller (eg Arduino, Raspberry Pi)

As part of my Workshop Automation Project I need to detect mains voltages (why? watch the video!) and this little unit will ensure I don't fry my Raspberry Pi whilst doing so. Can you imagine? Bacon's fried his Pi!

I've included a link here to where I got this device (UK seller) but you can get it many places.

I've also included a small sketch you can use to test it out but you really don't need the module (or mains) to test out the sketch!

And there was a moment of confusion as to what a PLC was (no, not a public limited company, but a Programmable Logic Controller) so this is the definition:

What is a PLC (programmable Logic Controller)

I've expressed my concern over mains electricity safety in my video a few times, as I can't afford to lose any viewers or subscribers - so don't take risks with this device. When it's connected to the mains you hands should be nowhere near it. It's all too easy to forget that it is at mains potential and just pick it up!
